ðŸ‘‹ I have been working in Web development and software engineering for over 30 years.  My day job is software engineering management but I still love to dabble in various tech outside of my job.

I enjoyed putting together a series of blog posts called  [My Media Server Project](/posts/my-media-server-project/), that runs down how I created a setup using Jellyfin, Caddy, Nextcloud, Syncthing and some scripting to make my family's media collection easily accessible to them.
