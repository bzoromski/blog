Now that the Jellyfin server for [My Media Server Project](/posts/my-media-server-project/) was set up and [Caddy was configured](/posts/setting-up-caddy/) I started getting my family members set up with Jellyfin client software.  

## Computers
On both Windows PCs and Linux boxes it's easiest to just use a web browser, and with Caddy doing the reverse proxy and SSL certificate, it's super easy to log in.

## Apple Devices
My family uses iOS devices so for browsing photos and videos we installed the official [Jellyfin Mobile app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/jellyfin-mobile/id1480192618) from the App Store.

But for listening to music stored on our Jellyfin server I've found the best and easiest app to use is [Finamp](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/finamp/id1574922594). It's got a really easy to use interface, allows you to favorite albums, artists, playlists and genres (and easily access those favorites), and also has a really slick Offline Mode that lets you play any music you've downloaded from your Jellyfin server, whether you have an Internet connection or not.

## Amazon FireTV
We also have Amazon FireTV sticks and the [official Jellyfin app](https://www.amazon.com/Jellyfin-for-Fire-TV/dp/B07TX7Z725) works great on there for browsing photos, watching videos and listening to music.
